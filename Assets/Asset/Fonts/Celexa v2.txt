This is version 2.0 of Celexa, with major kerning adjustments and a new lowercase m. Also yen and euro symbols have been added.

Now that my attention has been brought back to this font (thanks Quiller), I should let you know that Celexa, though usable in every version, will be a work in progress for a while from now. I see a lot of room for improvement in it, and it's only a matter of finding the time do apply some changes.

Will do, will do.

Be happy...
